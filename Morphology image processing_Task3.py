"""
Morphology Image Processing
(Due date: Nov. 26, 11:59 P.M., 2021)

The goal of this task is to experiment with commonly used morphology
binary image processing techniques. Use the proper combination of the four commonly used morphology operations, 
i.e. erosion, dilation, open and close, to remove noises and extract boundary of a binary image. 
Specifically, you are given a binary image with noises for your testing, which is named 'task3.png'.  
Note that different binary image might be used when grading your code. 

You are required to write programs to: 
(i) implement four commonly used morphology operations: erosion, dilation, open and close. 
    The stucturing element (SE) should be a 3x3 square of all 1's for all the operations.
(ii) remove noises in task3.png using proper combination of the above morphology operations. 
(iii) extract the boundaries of the objects in denoised binary image 
      using proper combination of the above morphology operations. 
Hint: 
â€¢ Zero-padding is needed before morphology operations. 

Do NOT modify the code provided to you.
You are NOT allowed to use OpenCV library except the functions we already been imported from cv2. 
You are allowed to use Numpy libraries, HOWEVER, 
you are NOT allowed to use any functions or APIs directly related to morphology operations.
Please implement erosion, dilation, open and close operations ON YOUR OWN.
